# MyUsedPots

https://riceicetea.github.io/my-used-pots/ (web version)

My Used Pots (anagram for study poems) is a simple app made to aid you memorize poems. It builds upon the work of https://github.com/arvidj/poemizer , re-implementing it in Flutter, and adding a few extra bits.

The default poem is Kölcsey Ferenc: Zrínyi dala currently.

A GitHub CI bot builds android apps and the web app on every commit. Download the android folder from the assets, unzip, and install the APK for your architecture. Currently, google play will give a warning because the APK is signed with debug keys.
