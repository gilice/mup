My Used Pots (anagram for `study poems`) is a simple app made to aid you memorize poems. It builds upon the work of https://github.com/arvidj/poemizer, re-implementing it in Flutter, and adding a few extra bits.

The default poem is `Kölcsey Ferenc: Zrínyi dala` currently.


A GitHub CI bot builds android apps and the web app on every commit. Download the `android` folder from the assets, unzip, and install the APK for your architecture. Currently, google play will give a warning because the APK is signed with debug keys.
