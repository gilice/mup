This is a [Nix Flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) to build a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) app with the help of Nix. In comparison to other templates I've seen, it does work building Linux apps with `flutter build linux`. It does throw warnings about not finding `mount` which I haven't managed to fix yet, but apps seem to build fine.
